# MagisterAPI
a simple api i wrote to interface with magister

for this api to work you will need some things
- python3
- selenium
- chromedriver

#### python
i will not go over the install of python, i assume you have python already if you are going to use this

#### selenium
selenium is a piece of software to automate and interface with browsers.  
You can download selenium using `pip install selenium` or `pip3 install selenium`

#### chromedriver
install chromedriver from [this site](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started)
not much to say about it, for me it was already intalled with cromium (ubuntu) and i can't find an clear instuction somewhere on how to do it
