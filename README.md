# MagisterAPI
A simple API I wrote to interface with magister.

For this API to work you will need some things:
- Python 3
- Selenium
- An driver

#### Python
I will not go over the install of python, I assume you have python already if you are going to use this.

#### Selenium
Selenium is a piece of software to automate and interface with browsers.  
You can download selenium using `pip install selenium` or `pip3 install selenium`.

#### Drivers
Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. Make sure itâ€™s in your PATH, e. g., place it in `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`.
Links to some of the more popular browser drivers:

* Edge: 	https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/
* Firefox: 	https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
